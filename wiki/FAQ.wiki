== You add the page ID at end of URL. Why have you done such a horrible thing? ==

Imagine that the URL change because the has moved the page in the tree or because
the user has *changed the slug*.

What will happened if someone have published the old URL in a forum? He will get a 404 error. We cannot accept this.

If you want to never break URLs without restraining the user the id trick seems like an acceptable solution.

Otherwise if you really want to get ride of this ID you can set PAGE_UNIQUE_SLUG_REQUIRED to True into your settings and make the necessary modifications to the pages.url, page.views and pages.models.get_url.

== how could I specify meta description for each page (in each language)? ==

If you want to have a field for the description meta tag just add a placeholder in your template:

{{{
<meta name="keywords" content="{% placeholder meta_description current_page TextInput %}" />
}}}

And an translated field should appears in the admin. (for each language)
