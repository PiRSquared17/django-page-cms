== You add the page ID at end of URL. How can I change that? ==

if you want to get ride of this ID you can set PAGE_UNIQUE_SLUG_REQUIRED to True into your settings and the default front end will use the slug instead of the ID of the page.

== How can I specify a meta description for each page and for each language? ==

If you want to have a field for the description meta tag just add a placeholder in your template:

{{{
<meta name="keywords" content="{% placeholder meta_description current_page TextInput %}" />
}}}

And an translated field should appears in the admin.

== How can I show content part of the page without using a placeholder?==

The show_content template tags is here for that:

{{{
{% show_content the_page_object "the_content_type" %}
}}}

You can also specify the slug of the page instead of the page object itself:

{{{
{% show_content "my-page-slug" "the_content_type" %}
}}}
