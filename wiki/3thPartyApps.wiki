#summary a way to integrate 3th party apps into the CMS admin interface

Django page cms provide a basic way to integrate forms into page admin in order to create page related object. For this you need an object with foreign key pointing to a page:

{{{
class Document(models.Model):
    "A dummy model used to illustrate the use of linked models in django-page-cms"

    title = models.CharField(_('title'), max_length=100, blank=False)
    text = models.TextField(_('text'), blank=True)

    # the foreign key *must* be called page
    page = models.ForeignKey(Page)

class DocumentForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Document
}}}

After that you need to set the PAGE_CONNECTED_MODELS into your settings:

{{{
PAGE_CONNECTED_MODELS = [
    {'model':'documents.models.Document','form':'documents.models.DocumentForm'},
]
}}}

When you edit a page, you should see a form to create a Document object linked to this page.
