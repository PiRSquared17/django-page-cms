= How to use Hierarchical with other objects =

It's a good thing to define a `get_admin_url` method into your model if you want a link into linked objects of the hierarchical page.

== How to retrieve the node(s) of an object ==

Here an example with a page object

{{{
current_page = Page.published.get(id=int(page_id))
nodes = HierarchicalNode.get_nodes_by_object(current_page)
}}}

An object can be linked with mutiple nodes, but it's not the case for a Page object so you can safely do:

{{{
node = nodes[0]
}}}

You have your associated node. You can now use it to retrieve all linked object:

{{{
all_objects = node.get_objects()
}}}

You have now a list of all objects associated with the node of your page. You can link any sort of object that you application provide and build a CMS upon it.
