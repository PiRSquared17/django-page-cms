=== r238 (Nov 26, 2008) ===

Removed `blank` and `null` options on the `sites` field of the `Page` model to enforce validation. That's now mandatory given the new `CurrentSiteMiddleware`. Change your site objects to match your domain(s)!

No worries if you use different subdomains on the same Django instance, pages checks if the request host ends with one of the Site instances.

=== r224 (Nov 23, 2008) ===

Moved [http://code.google.com/p/django-page-cms/source/browse/trunk#trunk/example example project] to its own subdirectory in the subversion root.

In case you updated from a previous version please make sure all remaining `*.pyc` files are deleted from your checkout before you run the example project again. On Linux/Unix systems that can be achieved by running the following command in the django-page-cms checkout directory:

{{{
find . -name '*.pyc' -exec rm {} \;
}}}

=== r222/r223 (Nov 23, 2008) ===

Added a !CurrentSiteMiddleware middleware that is now mandatory. This enables django-page-cms to serve multiple domains without having to have multiple Django processes.

Please modify your settings to look like this:

{{{
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    # ..
    'pages.middleware.CurrentSiteMiddleware',
)
}}}

===  r207 (Nov 18, 2008) ===

Added new !DateTime field "publication_end_date" to Page model.

Use the following SQL statement as a helper if you need to modify existing data:

{{{
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE pages_page
    ADD COLUMN publication_end_date datetime NULL;
COMMIT;
}}}
