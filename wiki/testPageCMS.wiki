#summary Testing as a CMS

= Introduction =

To test page-cms and see how it works you can directly:

 * Download the last version from trunk at svn checkout http://django-page-cms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-page-cms
 * On the downloaded folder, run:
{{{
manage.py syncdb
manage.py runserver
}}}

You'll be asked about the administrator user, for example type *admin* and *test*. The application will create an sqlite3 file.

 * run your browser and point to http://localhost:8000/admin

 * Once logged, you must create some languages, for example, type en/en , es/es, etc.
